# Functions

Deployer provides a lot of helpful functions. Make sure to learn about them!

``` php
run(string $command)
```

Runs a command on a remote server in the working path (`server(...)->env('deploy_path', '/home/path')`).

``` php
cd(string $path)
```

Sets the working path for the following `run` functions. Every task restores the working path to the base working path at the beginning of the task.

``` php
runLocally(string $command)
```

Runs a command on your local machine.

``` php
upload(string $file, string $uploadFile)
```

Upload a file from your machine to your deployment machine
You can use environment in both $file and $uploadFile - meaning you can type something like this

upload('.deploy/parameters.{{env}}.yml', '{{release_path}}/app/config/parameters.yml');

Which will be translated to something like this

upload('.deploy/parameters.dev.yml', '/var/www/release/current/app/config/parameters.yml');


``` php
 write(string $message)
```

Write message in the console. You can format the message with the tags `<info>...</info>`, `<comment></comment>` or `<error></error>` (see [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html#coloring-the-output)).

``` php
 writeln(string $message)
```

Same as the `write` function, but also writes a new line.

``` php
ask(string $message, mixed $default)
```

Ask the user for input. You need to specify a default value which will be used in quiet mode.

``` php
askConfirmation(string $message[, bool $default = false])
```

Ask the user a yes or no question.

``` php
askHiddenResponse(string $message)
```

Ask the user for a password.

``` php
output()
```

Get the current console output.
